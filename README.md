Making graphs of player-player connections on twitter

Python 2.7, python-twitter, python-igraph

If you use any of this stuff show your appreciation by liking my band, High Heat, on Facebook -> https://www.facebook.com/highheatrocks/ ! 

I'm open to forks, pushes, whatever if someone wants to add/correct anything. 

Thanks,
